# stone-paper-scissor-game
Author:- Jenit Sutaria
This is my very first project.
This is basically a game we use to play when we were children called stone, paper, scissors.
The rules are quite simple; stone beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats stone.
The user shall enter an input dedicated to stone, paper, scissors and the computer will select one from its end and the result shall be given at last.
