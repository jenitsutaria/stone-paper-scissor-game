# stone-paper-scissor-game
Author:- Jenit Sutaria
<br>
This is my very first project.
<br>
This is basically a game we use to play when we were children called stone, paper, scissors.
<br>
The rules are quite simple; stone beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats stone.
<br>
The user shall enter an input dedicated to stone, paper, scissors and the computer will select one from its end and the result shall be given at last.
